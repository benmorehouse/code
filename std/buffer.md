	Build something cool of your own that can do something similar with all of that 
	go through the rest of the gophercises when you can. 
	You have yet to start the crawler project

	STD Issues to fix in ver 3.0:
		sort the keys that you display in terms of alphabetical order
		need to create the list rename function
		need to create some sort of notepad section to list the available notes that you are working on
		make something that will show all of the aliases that you have made for std
		You could also come up with something that will let you send this note to someone via an imessage or email
		Figure out how to screen grab the whole thing
