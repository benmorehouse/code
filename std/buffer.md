	Jenny Wong 
	jcwong@amazon.com
	24/7 service for questions and concerns for what is going 
	there is a whole level of certifications for AWS that you can get into and you can get more invivled with that 

# Second presentation

	startup kit - an aws github repo that has a lot of startup templates for what we are working on 
	make sure you are shutting down the resources when you are using machine learning resources through aws
	
	george -# go and get all five green checkboxes on your aws account

	what is a container?:
		docker is the most popularized one for working with containers fyi
		Essentially the contain none of the operating system code and instead just has application code and such that
		is needed to run a virtual machine. It is essentially a way to make things transfer and create environments.
	
	Fargate is essentially the step after the container which means that AWS manages everyting that we want from an
	application.

	Firecracker is a way to run mircro vms - definitely take a look into this 	
	
	Lambda is best used when your function is going to take less than 15 minutes	


	An availability zone is a data center that is connected to each other in certain locations across the world
	An availability zone is important to have not because of the particular use but because you normally will apply your
	application with several availability zones. There are public and private subnets within AZ's. That way when one zone
	breaks from overloading or other issues, we have other ones to fall back on while we fix the issues that we have

	public subnet should have your load balancer but then the actual database that you are using should be in the private
	subnet within the Availability zone
	
	we should look into graphdb and specifically neptune because that can help with certain connectivity that is also 
	found on things like linkedin with second and third degree connections

# End of presentation Questions/Comments
	We should definitely reach out to these two people and see if they can help us with anything with OL
	Good resources for us to look into to learn more technical skills with AWS:
		acloud.guru - the aws solutions architect exam. Good for some baseline stuff. Dont skip the VPC, IM and 
			security groups. It is a dry subject but it is good to have under your belt. 
		awsgeek.com - this is a good way to reference architecture for applications	
		eksworkshop.com


# Working with Piotr


	VIM GO is something that should be used for when you name the files in your functions and such
		It automatically formats the code once you get it going

	The best way to do this with overlooked and look and see if which faculty members would be the most interested in the
