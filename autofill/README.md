#Autofiller for html-based code

##Able to use to edit script based around certain keywords


This is an application that I built which will:
	- sift through go files and find text you indicate of case
	- return a new go file with the indicated text you wanted it replaced
Interface:
	You will be prompted with initial input. This is the filename and the word you want to search for.
	You will then be prompted with a new word it should replace. Enter this in as you wish it to be (Camel Cased, etc)
