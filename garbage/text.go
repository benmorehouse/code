She talked very highly of the low voltage team at Tesla, and it seems to be an incredibly interesting project for a software engineer like myself. I am interested in interning for 8+ months and making major contribut    ions. If the timing isnt right, I would really appreciate if you could pass on my profile to other people where I would be useful."
